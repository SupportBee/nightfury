# Nightfury

**This gem is not yet production ready**

## Concept

Nightfury provides a reporting framework built on Redis for Ruby/Ruby on Rails applications. The framework is designed 
to store differnt metrics in a time series or as a single value which can be easily queried. The following are the key terms:

### Identity

Like a company or a ticket or a user (anything that we want stats on very quickly)
Has an id (can auto-generate but generally provided so you can map it to your db ids etc)
Has metrics

### Metrics

A identity has many metrics.

* Metric can be a single value or a time series. 
* The value can be aggregate (average)
* When you ask for the metric back, you can specify a time range for the values that you want back (if time series)

### Tags

Identities can be tagged and have multiple tags
You can ask for stats for identities with certain tags over a particular time range (if asking for metrics that are series)

## Usage

**See example.rb for usage**
